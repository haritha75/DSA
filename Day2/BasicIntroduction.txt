How to Apporoach a problem :
  
      -> We have 5 levels mainly.

      Read the problem ----> Analyize the problem ----> Think of a solution ----> Pen down the solution ----> Code the solution

      -> And also we have three types of pen down solution.
          
          1) Flowchart
          2) Algorithm
          3) Pseudo Code

If you have multiple solutions which solution you can choose ?

        -> choose Based on time and space complexity problem.
        -> choose which solution is take less time and space complexity.

Trade-off :

        -> It means giving up of one thing in return for another like exchange type.
        -> In problem solving sometimes time complexity increases and space decrease or space increases and time decrease.        

What is the difference between c and c++?

      -> c is a procedural alngauge.
      -> c++ is a object oriented language.

What is procedural?

     -> It is a method process like c language without classes and object we can use only methods.

What is difference between c++ and java?

      -> In c++ we have pointers concept but security java does not suppoort.
      -> java is platform independent and also  have multithreading concept.
