//What value will this program output when calling the function funk(n), if n=10?

function funk(n):
    a = 1
    b = 1
    x = 0
    for j in (2, n - 1):
        x = a + b
        a = b
        b = x
    return x


OutPut:
  
    55 because it is in the form of fibonacci series : 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55. here start with 2 and it iterate 8 times.
