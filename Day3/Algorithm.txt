what is algorithm ?
        
        -> Algorithm means " A set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations. or
        -> A procedure for solving mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations.

Why we need  algorithms?

        -> Algorithms are necessary for solving complex problems efficiently and effectively. 
        -> They help to automate processes and make them more reliable, faster, and easier to perform.
        -> The are set of rules that guide the software in performing solving problems.

Characteristics of an Algorithm?

     1. Clear and unambiguous
     2. Well defined inputs
     3. Language independent
     4. Feasible
     5. Finite-ness 
     6. Well defined outputs

Advantages of Algorithms:
------------------------

     -> It is easy to understand.
     -> An algorithm is a step-wise representation of a solution to a given problem.

Disadvantages of Algorithms:
---------------------------

    -> Writing an algorithm takes a long time so it is time-consuming.
    -> Understanding complex logic through algorithms can be very difficult.
    -> Branching and Looping statements are difficult to show in Algorithms.


How to Design an Algorithm?
---------------------------

    -> The problem that is to be solved by this algorithm i.e. clear problem definition.
    -> The constraints of the problem must be considered while solving the problem.
    -> The input to be taken to solve the problem.
    -> The output is to be expected when the problem is solved.
    -> The solution to this problem is within the given constraints.
