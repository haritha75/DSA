Linear Data Structure:

    -> In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order.
    -> single level is involved.
    -> implementation is easy.
    -> memory is not utilized in an efficient way.  
    -> Elementa ca b e traversed in single run.
    -> Examples are: array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
    -> useful for simple data storage and manipulation. 
    -> Performance is good for simple operations.

Non-Linear Data Structure:

    -> In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.
    -> multiple levels are involved.
    -> implementation is complex.
    -> memory is utilized in an efficient way.
    -> Elements cannot be traversed in single run.
    -> Examples are: trees, graphs etc...
    -> useful for representing complex relationships and data hierarchies such as in social networks.
    -> Performance can vary depending on the structure and the operation.
