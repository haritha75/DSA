What is Programming?

   Programming:
      
      -> Set of instructions given to computer based on instructions computer will Performance the operations.
      -> Programming is not about typing, it is about thinking.

What is Coding?

  Coding:

    -> Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete tasks.
    -> Computer doesnot understand english language that's why we are given high level language to the computer. 

 Why we need Data Structure:

     -> To build fast and scalable Algorithms.
     -> Cost Saving and efficient.
     -> Art of problem solving because their is many ways to solve problems but based on the situations and requirements we can solve the problems.

Data Structure Types:

    They are two types.  

        Linear                                         Non-Linear

    -> Arrays                                      -> graphs
    -> LinkedList                                  -> trees
    -> Stacks
    -> Queues
    -> HashMap

Clean Code:

   -> Clean code is clear,understandable and matainable.
   -> It caontains class names are pascal case and methods,variables names are camel case.    
   -> It makes easy to understand the code.
   -> Donot use comments because already we are given meaningful names to the code then donot need comments.

   DRY principle:
    
      -> It means donot repeat yourself if you have repeatitions then use functions because functions can be used in many times in a code.
      -> If you write the same code in multiple places extract that into a function(reuse).

  KISS principle:   

      -> It means Keep it simple and stupid.
      -> Every function should do one thing only and do it well.
      -> Donot make code unnecessarily complex keep it simple. 


 -> Refactoring is part of the coding process.
