"infix," "postfix," and "prefix" are notations used to represent mathematical expressions.

    Infix Notation:
        Infix notation is the most common way of writing mathematical expressions, where operators are placed between operands.
        For example, in the expression "3 + 5," the operator "+" is placed between the operands "3" and "5."

    Postfix Notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation or RPN):
        Postfix notation represents expressions by placing operators after their operands.
        For example, the expression "3 + 5" in postfix notation would be written as "3 5 +."
        Postfix notation is useful for easy evaluation of expressions using a stack-based algorithm.

    Prefix Notation (also known as Polish Notation):
        Prefix notation represents expressions by placing operators before their operands.
        For example, the expression "3 + 5" in prefix notation would be written as "+ 3 5."
        Like postfix notation, prefix notation is also used for efficient evaluation algorithms.

The main uses of these notations are as follows:

    Infix notation is the most familiar to humans and is often used in everyday mathematical expressions.
    Postfix and prefix notations are more suitable for computer processing and are commonly used in programming languages and 
    calculators because they eliminate the need for parentheses to specify the order of operations. They also simplify parsing and evaluation.

When using postfix or prefix notations, you can easily evaluate expressions using stacks or recursive algorithms.
