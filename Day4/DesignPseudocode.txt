Pseudocode to find sum of two numbers:

    a = 4
    b = 15
    c = a+b
    print(c)

How to read input:

    a = input()

Assigning value:

    a = 5
    b = a
    print(b)

Arithmetic operations:


   sum = a+b
   sub = a-b
   mul = a*b
   div = a/b
   r = a mod b 

Logical operations:

   a > b and a < c
   a > b or a < c
   not a    

Relational operations:

   a > b
   a >= b
   a < b 
   a <= b 
   a == b 
   a != b
