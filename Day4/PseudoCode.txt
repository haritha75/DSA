Pseudocode :
 
          -> Pseudocode is a way of representing an anglorithm using informal, human readable language.
          -> It is the form of plain language their is not more syntaxes.
          -> It is easy to understand when compared to algorithm because algorithm conttains some logics also but in pseudo code total in plain text form.
          -> If some person no idea of about programming then read Pseudocode ,they can understand  easily without knowledge on programming.
          -> It helps to design and plan their algorithms.
          -> It acts as a bridge between the program and algorithm.
          -> It is a powerful tool that promotes clear thinking and efficient problem solving in the development process.


Advantages :

    1) Collaboration :
          
          -> It can be understood by developers with different programming backgrounds,communication within a team.

    2) Clarity :

          -> It uses human readable language, making it easier to undrerstand and communicate complext algorithms.

    3) Planning and Design :

             -> It can help to the programmmers paln and design algorithms before implementation.

    4) Reduced Errors :

           -> By identifyinf the logic or some errors early in development process, it can help reducing the errors in the final code.
