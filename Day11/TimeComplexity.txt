Why Companies Develop software?
 
   -> Because Customer want to better services and fast which company have this qualities then customer always prefer that type of companies.
   -> if companies develop better service and fast then automatically customers increases and get more profit and revenue.

     Better Services, fast ---> more customers --> more revenue --> more profit

Why Time Complexity  not meausred in seconds ?

        When measuring time complexity in seconds, the result would heavily depend on the hardware and software environment in which the algorithm is running.
    Different computers have varying processing speeds, memory capabilities, and other hardware components that can affect how fast an algorithm executes. 
    Additionally, the same algorithm can perform differently depending on the programming language, compiler optimizations, and other software factors.

        For example, imagine you have two algorithms, Algorithm A and Algorithm B. Algorithm A completes in 1 second on a fast computer with  memory, 
    while Algorithm B takes 5 seconds on the same computer. However, if you run these algorithms on a slower computer with limited memory, Algorithm B might take just 2 seconds, 
    and Algorithm A might take 10 seconds.
