Psuedo Code:


1. Create a Stack

2. Iterate the expression

3. If c is operand add it to the result or output
        ( : push to the Stack
        ) : Pop from stack and add to result or output until opening bracket
        
    else
        if stack is empty
            push it to stack
        else
            compare with peek means top element
                if higher precedence push to stack
                else pop and add to result or output until lower precedence found
