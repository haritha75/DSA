Statck memory:
  
  -> It stores primitive data types.
  -> It follows the LIFO order
  -> It is not flexible because we cannot alter the allocated memeory.
  -> It has faster access, allocation.
  -> Memory size is very small.
  -> It is done automatically by the compiler.
  -> Cost is less.
  -> Memory allocation is continuous.
  -> It is a thread safe because each thread has its own stack.

Heap memeory:

    -> It stores reference type objects.
    -> It does not faollow any order because it is a dynamic Memory allocation and it doesnot have fixed pattern for allocation.
    -> It is flexible because we can alter the allocated memeory.
    -> It has slower access,allocation.
    -> Memory size is large.
    -> It is done in manually by the programmer.
    -> Cost is more compared to stack.
    -> Memeory allocation is random order.
    -> It is not thread safe. 
    -> String also non-primitive it store inside the heap.
    -> String literal store in inside string pool but string object store in outside the strirng pool and inside the heap.
