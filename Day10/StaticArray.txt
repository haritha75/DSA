Static Array:

  -> static array means once size is fixed it cannot changed.
     
         int a[]=new int[5]; like this.

        -> we cannot add 6th element only 5 elments can insert.

     Advantages :

       -> index based access to elements is fast
       -> Efficient since address of the element is known.

    Disadvantages :

       -> Fixed size we cannot change.
       -> If you declare large size then need only small data then memory wastage.
       -> If you declare small size then you need large data then we cannot increase the size of the array.

How to calculate the address in array :

     -> address = base + (size of datatype * index) 

Operation On static Array :


   1) Insertion -> Insertion can be done if you have the space in array that only we can insert other wise it shows arrayindexoutofbound exception.
     
       -> if you insert at the end of the array it will take 0(1) complexity in best case.
       -> if you insert at middel it take 0(n/2) and beggining it takes 0(n) in worst case.

   2) Deletion :
    
       -> if you delete at the end of the array it will take 0(1) complexity in best case.
       -> if you delete at middel it take 0(n/2) and beggining it takes 0(n) in worst case.
          
  3) Searching :
    
    -> searching can be done in two ways.

       1) value based it takes 0(1)
       2) Address based it takes 0(n)
